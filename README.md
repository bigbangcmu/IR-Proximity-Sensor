# IR-Proximity-Sensor
**The IR Proximity Sensor** is designed to detect nearby objects using infrared light reflection. It emits an infrared beam and detects the reflected signal from an object within a range of approximately 3 to 80 centimeters. The sensor outputs a digital signal (LOW or HIGH) when an object is detected.

A built-in potentiometer allows for adjusting the detection range, and its narrow ±15° sensing angle makes it suitable for precise object detection. It is widely used in robotics, automation, and motion-activated systems.

## This sensor is suitable for:
- Human or object detection
- Obstacle detection in robotics
- Automatic lighting and counting systems
